  <p class="text">An activity was carried out with a ninth-grade class in the morning session called “The Positive Thoughts Mailbox.” 
It consisted of students writing a positive or motivational phrase (advice) that they believed could help someone going through a difficult time. 
Then, randomly, problems were assigned, and they shared how they would help.

    <p class="text2">Activity Objectives
    <p class="text3">They focused on strengthening students' empathy — putting themselves in others' shoes regarding the proposed problems. 
It also aimed to improve emotional expression, allowing students to feel free to give motivational messages. 
In addition, it sought to strengthen group unity, so that through positive messages they realized that no one in the classroom is alone and that there will always be someone willing to listen and offer support, whether friends or not.

   <p class="text4">Analysis</p>
   <p class="text5">During the activity, it was observed how students were able to express supportive phrases, helping them recognize that such words can serve as emotional support in any situation. 
The survey results were valuable because they showed that students felt confident to express themselves.
